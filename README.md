# Whitepages-Reverse-Phone-NodeJS

This is a Node.js example of the WhitePages Pro API. There wasn't a Node.js example, so I decided to create my own.
To start from master simply clone this repo

```
$ git clone https://github.com/robertsonsamuel/Whitepages-Reverse-Phone-NodeJS.git
```
Then :  
```
$ cd Whitepages-Reverse-Phone-NodeJS
$ npm install 
$ npm start

```
Make sure to have a MongoDB server running.
